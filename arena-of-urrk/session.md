# Paid in Advance

The party receives an urgent yet cryptic message from a prospective employer.

```
To the Guild of Monster Hunters,

Word of your deeds has reached far, and many have heard tell of your bravery and skill.

My employer, who for security reasons must remain anonymous, along with myself,
finds himself in need of a team of highly skilled mercenaries - for reasons which,
again, due to security concerns, cannot be disclosed in writing.

My employer understands that such levels of secrecy can lead to unease in those
from whom the secret is being kept, which is why, as a show of good faith, he has
elected to deliver partial payment in advance, delivered with this message.

If you wish to continue with this contract, a meeting has been arranged in the
Lager Cellar tavern in the city of Larrad. When you arrive, present this letter,
along with the identifying seal, to the barkeep.
```

The party recieves 2k gold each.


# Take The Bait

The party goes to the Lager Cellar tavern in the city of Larrad.

Larrad is claustraphobic Dwarven city carved into the Five Kings Mountains.
Space is a premium in such a city, limited in size by the cavern walls from 
which it was carved. As such, the streets are narrow. Between clusters of ancient
Dwarven cathedrals lie rows of houses, inns, taverns, and other places of work and
residence, built tightly beside and atop one another.

It is on one of these streets the party finds the Lager Cellar tavern - the front door
wedged tightly, almost hidden, between a blacksmithery and a butcher's storefront.

A narrow staircase leads down from the front door. The staircase makes a sharp left turn
as the party passes a single wall mounted torch, before finally ending with a short landing
and another door.

[Perception 20]
- Party notices the section of the wall that slides out, but are unaware of its function.

[Perception 30]
- Party notices scrape marks on the floor, and the contact point for the sliding section.

The party opens the door into a dimly lit cellar with a small bar and a few tables. A few
Dwarf patrons sit around one of the tables, drinking in silence. Another Dwarf stands behind
the bar counter, cleaning a drinking glass.

The party shows the barkeep the letter.

The barkeep motions for other patrons to leave through front door. Once they are gone,
he tells the party to wait here and goes through a back door.

## Sedative Encounter

Some encounter with very high probability of sedating entire party.
Possibly Sweetdream poison.
