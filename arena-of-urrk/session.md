# Paid in Advance

The party receives an urgent yet cryptic message from a prospective employer.

```
To the Guild of Monster Hunters,

Word of your deeds has reached far, and many have heard tell of your bravery and
skill.

My employer, who for security reasons must remain anonymous, along with myself,
finds himself in need of a team of highly skilled mercenaries - for reasons which,
again, due to security concerns, cannot be disclosed in writing.

My employer understands that such levels of secrecy can lead to unease in those
from whom the secret is being kept, which is why, as a show of good faith, he has
elected to deliver partial payment in advance, delivered with this message.

If you wish to continue with this contract, a meeting has been arranged in the
Dust Cellar tavern in the city of Larrad. When you arrive, present this letter,
along with the identifying seal, to the barkeep.
```

The party recieves 2k gold each.

# Dust Cellar

## Take the Bait

The party goes to the Dust Cellar tavern in the city of Larrad.

Larrad is claustraphobic Dwarven city carved into the Five Kings Mountains.
Space is a premium in such a city, limited in size by the cavern walls from 
which it was carved. As such, the streets are narrow. Between clusters of
ancient Dwarven cathedrals lie rows of houses, inns, taverns, and other places 
of work and residence, built tightly beside and atop one another.

[Knowledge Local/Architecture 15]
- Dwarven cities like this are often built with secret catacombs and other hidden underground passages.

It is on one of these narrow streets the party finds the Dust Cellar tavern -
the front door wedged tightly, almost hidden, between a blacksmithery and a
butcher's storefront.

A narrow staircase leads down from the front door. The staircase makes a sharp
left turn at the site of a single wall mounted torch, before finally ending
in a short landing with another door.

The party opens the door into a dimly lit cellar with a small bar and a few
tables. A few Dwarf patrons sit around one of the tables, drinking in silence.
Another Dwarf stands behind the bar counter, cleaning a drinking glass.

[Perception 12]
- Notice a pipe leading up the back wall and across the ceiling, above the bar.
- Slits are cut into the sides of the pipe, seemingly for ventilation

[Perception 25]
- Notice the back door has sealed gaps, which seem intended to block airflow.

The party shows the barkeep the letter.

The barkeep motions for other patrons to leave through front door.

[Perception 18]
- Notice them lock the door on their way out.

Once they are gone, he tells the party to wait here and goes through a
reinforced door in the back.

[Perception 25]
- Notice, on his way out, he bars the door.


## Sweet Dreams

Sweetdream poison is pumped in through air vents and fills the room.

- Surprise Round
    - [Perception 18]
        - Notice poisonous gas.

- Round One

```
Thuromir,

My employer has been made aware of a steaming machine in your possession,
of which you reserve use for "private parties".

Soon, a group of mercenaries will come to your tavern bearning my seal.
When they do, you will lock them in your main room and fill the room with vapor.
Instead of steaming doses of kief, however, you will fill the room with the
contents of this vial. Be careful not to break the seal before use.

They will fall into a deep sleep, and you will bring them, using your
secret passageway through the sewers, to the entrance to the ancient tunnels.

Do this - my employer will keep the secret of your petty drug peddling to himself,
and he will consider your debt to him repaid.
```

# Arena (if knocked out in tavern)

## Wake up in a Strange Place

One by one the members of the party wake in a strange cell-like room.

There are two doorways opposite eachother. One holds a normal reinforced
wooden cell door, and the other a simple metal grating on which you see no hinges.

In a small chest in the corner of the cell you find 8 potions of cure light wounds

A few hours pass as the final party members wake. Finally, the metal grating
slides open.

The party walks down a long stone corridor. The faint sound of a cheering crowd
can be heard in the distance, growing louder as the party moves forward.

The corridor opens into a larger semi-circular tunnel with bare ground and stone
walls and ceiling.

The party leaves the small corridor and enters the larger tunnel.

Several other similar corridors seem to also let out in this tunnel, but they are
all sealed off with similar metal grating. Along the main tunnel, to the left,
lies a dead end - to the right, torchlight, another metal grating, and the sound
of the crowd.

[Perception 18]
- Notice the fight from this distance before approaching.

The party approaches the tunnel exit. Through the grating, they see a large
circular arena. As they near, they notice dead bodies scattered near
the entrance.

They hear a scream - a malnourished orc in tattered clothes runs across the
entrance, and, a moment later, a large bear in pursuit. The bear catches him
swiftley by the shoulder. A burst of blood erupts from the panicked orc's neck,
before he goes limp in the beasts jaws.

The crowd erupts into cheers. 

An announcer can be heard bellowing over the crowd.

"A brutal finish! The inmates put up a good fight, but even the mighty orc
crumbles before the beasts of nature!"

Another entrance to the arena opens, and handlers corral the animal out of the
arena. A few others come to clear the dead bodies.

The announcer again: "Ladies and gentlemen, we have something extra special
lined up for tonight. A fully equipped team of mercenaries against the gauntlet!"

The crowd can be heard hooting and hollering in excitement.

The gate into the arena opens slowly. You see an identical gate opening
simultaneously on the opposite side of the arena.

## Fight!

[Perception 15]
- Notice the health potions

- 3 Grizzley Bears (cr4x3)

- 4 Boars and 2 Dire Boars - (cr2x4 cr4x2)
    - Each dire boar has a bag tied to its back with 1 cure moderate wounds

- 4 Cave Trolls - (cr4x4)
    - Each cave troll has a cure moderate wounds in a similar back bag.

- Two Headed Troll and 6 Jackals - (cr8 cr1/2x6)

## Win the Arena (if success)

If they win the arena, announcer congratulates the party.

"Well done mercenaries! A fine performance in the face of crushing adversity.
As a reward, your lives will be spared and your freedom returned. Enter the
tunnel below my tower to collect your prize!"

## Lose the Arena (if not successful)

If half the party is dead or incapacitated at the end of a fight, a horn will blow
signalling the end of the gauntlet.

The announcer addresses the party.

"Looks like even the pros couldn't handle the gauntlet! Mercinaries, enter
the tunnel below the tower with your wounded and your lives will be spared."

## Wake in familiar place.

As soon as they enter the small room, metal doors slide down and seal them in.
Sweetdream is pumped into the chamber, lulling them into a deep sleep.

The party wakes in a stable near the gates of Larrad. 

### If they won the arena
They wake with a bag containing 8k gold
and a note.
```
Well done.
```

# Payback (if success in tavern)

## Sewers

The party enters the secret door into a dwarven sewer that seems somehow
